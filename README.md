### Split Component

#### Split even

By using the `even` property of the split element you are able to split a slide evenly
The `gap` property defines how much space should be between the columns of the split element

	---
	theme: css/mattropolis.css
	transition: none
	---

	<!-- .slide: data-background="white" data-background-image="https://picsum.photos/id/3/960/700" data-background-opacity="0.4" -->


	# Our Team <!-- .element: class="align-right" -->

#### Split left/right

If you want to split a slide proportionally you can do that with left and right properties. Left and right represent the proportions of the slide columns. For example if you want a right column that is twice wide as the left column you should set `left="1"` and `right="2"`

	<!-- .slide: data-background="white" data-background-image="https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/gray-abstract-wireframe-technology-background_53876-101941.jpg" -->

	<style>
	.activity-label {
		background-color:lightgray;
		padding: 8px 16px;
		border: 1px solid black;
	}
	</style>
	<split left="3" right="7" gap="1">

	## Activity 2:
	Divide each shape into the number of equal parts shown, taking the circle as exaple. All parts must be identical
